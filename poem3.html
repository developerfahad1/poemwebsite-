    A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br> Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,<br> Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,<br> Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.

<p>Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out<br> Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,<br> Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br> Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.
